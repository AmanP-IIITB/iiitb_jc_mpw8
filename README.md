A Johnson counter is a modified ring counter in which the output from the last flip flop is inverted and fed back as an input to the first. It is also called as Inverse Feedback COunter or Twisted Ring Counter. It is used in hardware logic design to create complicated Finite States Machine (FSM) eg: ASIC and FPGA design. It roughly consumes 80-100 mW of power and runs at a clock frequency of 36 MHz.
